## Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against. The changes on the `main`
branch are tagged into a release monthly.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/hospitease/hospit-ease/fork/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.
2. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

3. Install the dependencies with:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file:

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`.

5. Start developing and watch for code changes:

   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Building

```sh
pnpm run lint
```

If you get errors, be sure to fix them before committing.
